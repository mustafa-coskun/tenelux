# Trust Score System User Guide

## What is the Trust Score System?

The Trust Score System is a behavioral rating system that helps create fair and enjoyable multiplayer experiences in Tenebris Game. Your trust score reflects your communication patterns during games and helps match you with players who have similar play styles.

## How Trust Scores Work

### Trust Score Range
- **Range:** 0-100 points
- **Starting Score:** 50 points (neutral)
- **Higher Score:** Indicates more communicative gameplay
- **Lower Score:** Indicates more silent gameplay

### Trust Score Levels

| Score Range | Level | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | Very communicative and engaging player |
| 80-89 | Very Good | Regularly communicates during games |
| 70-79 | Good | Balanced communication style |
| 60-69 | Fair | Moderate communication |
| 50-59 | Average | Neutral communication pattern |
| 40-49 | Below Average | Less communicative |
| 0-39 | Poor | Rarely communicates during games |

## How Your Trust Score is Calculated

### What Affects Your Trust Score

1. **Communication During Games**
   - Speaking or typing during multiplayer games increases your score
   - Remaining silent throughout games decreases your score
   - Only multiplayer and party games count (single-player games don't affect trust score)

2. **Silence Ratio**
   - Your trust score is based on how often you communicate compared to other players
   - If you're silent in 30% of games and the average player is silent in 50% of games, your trust score will be higher than average

3. **Game Completion**
   - Only completed games count toward your trust score
   - Abandoned or disconnected games don't affect your score

### What Doesn't Affect Your Trust Score

- **Single-player games** - These don't count toward trust score calculations
- **Game performance** - Winning or losing doesn't directly affect trust score
- **Game duration** - Short or long games are weighted equally
- **Time of day** - When you play doesn't matter

## Viewing Your Trust Score

### In Your Profile
1. Go to your **Profile** screen
2. Your current trust score is displayed prominently at the top
3. Click on your trust score to see detailed behavior statistics

### Detailed Statistics
Your behavior statistics include:
- **Total Games:** Number of multiplayer/party games played
- **Silent Games:** Number of games where you didn't communicate
- **Silence Ratio:** Percentage of games where you remained silent
- **Behavior Trend:** Whether your communication is improving, stable, or declining

### Trust Score History
- Your trust score updates after each completed multiplayer or party game
- You can see your trend over time in the statistics screen
- Recent games have the same weight as older games

## How Trust Score Affects Matchmaking

### Matchmaking Priority
1. **Primary Factor:** The system tries to match you with players who have similar trust scores
2. **Tolerance Range:** You can set how strict you want trust score matching to be
3. **Fallback Matching:** If no similar trust score players are available, the system expands the search

### Matchmaking Preferences
You can customize how trust score affects your matchmaking:

1. **Go to Matchmaking Preferences**
2. **Adjust Trust Score Tolerance:**
   - **Strict (±5-10 points):** Only match with very similar players
   - **Moderate (±15-20 points):** Balanced matching
   - **Relaxed (±30-50 points):** Faster matching with wider range

### Benefits of Trust Score Matching
- **Better Communication:** Play with players who have similar communication styles
- **Reduced Frustration:** Avoid mismatched expectations about game interaction
- **Improved Experience:** More enjoyable games with compatible players

## Improving Your Trust Score

### For Players Who Want Higher Trust Scores

1. **Communicate During Games**
   - Use voice chat or text chat during multiplayer games
   - Even brief communications count (like "good game" or strategy discussions)
   - Consistent communication across games is more important than lengthy conversations

2. **Engage with Your Opponent**
   - Respond when other players communicate
   - Share strategy thoughts or reactions
   - Be friendly and sportsmanlike

3. **Play More Multiplayer Games**
   - Your trust score becomes more accurate with more games
   - Focus on multiplayer and party modes rather than single-player

### For Players Who Prefer Silent Play

1. **Understand the System**
   - Lower trust scores aren't "bad" - they just indicate a different play style
   - You'll be matched with other players who prefer quieter games
   - This can actually improve your experience by avoiding overly chatty opponents

2. **Set Appropriate Preferences**
   - Use relaxed trust score tolerance if you want faster matchmaking
   - Consider that some players enjoy communication as part of the game

3. **Occasional Communication**
   - Even minimal communication (like "gg" at the end) can help balance your score
   - You don't need to be constantly talking to maintain a reasonable trust score

## Trust Score in Different Game Modes

### Multiplayer Games
- **Full Impact:** All multiplayer games affect your trust score
- **Real-time Updates:** Your score updates immediately after each game
- **Competitive Focus:** Communication often involves strategy and reactions

### Party Games
- **Full Impact:** Party games count the same as multiplayer games
- **Social Context:** Communication might be more casual and friendly
- **Group Dynamics:** Your communication with multiple players is considered

### Single-Player Games
- **No Impact:** Single-player games don't affect trust score at all
- **Practice Mode:** Use single-player to practice without affecting your score
- **Separate Statistics:** Single-player stats are tracked separately

## Privacy and Trust Scores

### What Others Can See
- **Your Trust Score:** Other players can see your current trust score
- **Trust Score Level:** The descriptive level (Good, Excellent, etc.) is visible
- **General Range:** Players see if you're in a similar range for matchmaking

### What Others Cannot See
- **Detailed Statistics:** Your exact silence ratio and game counts are private
- **Behavior Trend:** Whether your score is improving or declining is private
- **Individual Game Data:** Specific games where you were silent/communicative are private

### Privacy Settings
- You can choose to hide your trust score from other players in Privacy Settings
- Hidden trust scores still work for matchmaking but aren't displayed to others
- This might affect some social features like party invitations

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why is my trust score not changing?
**A:** Trust scores update based on your communication relative to all players. If your communication pattern is consistent with the overall player base, your score may remain stable. Also, ensure you're playing multiplayer or party games, as single-player games don't affect trust score.

### Q: Can I reset my trust score?
**A:** Trust scores cannot be manually reset, but they naturally adjust as you play more games. If you change your communication style, your score will gradually reflect this change over time.

### Q: Is a low trust score bad?
**A:** No! Trust scores are about matching compatible play styles, not judging player quality. A lower trust score simply means you prefer quieter gameplay, and you'll be matched with similar players.

### Q: How many games do I need to play for an accurate trust score?
**A:** Your trust score starts working immediately, but becomes more accurate after 10-20 multiplayer games. The system continues to refine your score as you play more games.

### Q: Why am I matched with players who have different trust scores?
**A:** This can happen when:
- There aren't enough players with similar trust scores online
- Your matchmaking preferences allow wider trust score ranges
- You've been waiting in the queue for a long time (the system gradually expands search criteria)

### Q: Can I see other players' trust scores before accepting a match?
**A:** Yes, trust scores are displayed during the matchmaking process so you can make informed decisions about accepting matches.

### Q: Do trust scores affect party invitations?
**A:** Friends can invite you to parties regardless of trust score differences. However, some players might prefer to play with friends who have similar communication styles.

### Q: What happens if I'm consistently matched with incompatible players?
**A:** Try adjusting your matchmaking preferences to be more strict about trust score matching. You can also provide feedback about match quality to help improve the system.
