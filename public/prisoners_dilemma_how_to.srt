1
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:02,488
Player to play against each other. You

2
00:00:02,488 --> 00:00:05,335
each get 2 choices. You can cooperate or

3
00:00:05,335 --> 00:00:07,868
you can defect. If you both cooperate,

4
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:10,805
you each get 3 coins. If one of you

5
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:12,763
cooperates but the other defects, then

6
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,700
the one who defected gets 5 coins and the

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,984
other gets nothing. And if you both

8
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:20,921
defect then you each get a coin. The goal

9
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,858
of the game is simple, to get as many

10
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,163
coins as you can.
